        <h2> B1</h2>
        <p> we created a function called gradeReport that takes a given penguin and returns that penguin's grade.We then created an object for the function to return. We gave the object 2 attributes: grade and image. Within the grade attribute, we used the percentages from the syllabus to multiply them with the means of each category and then got the sum of those to get a final grade. Knowing that we get a report for one penguin we used map to get an array of reports for the classroom.</p>
        <pre>  var gradeReport=function(penguin){
    var report={ grade: d3.mean(penguin.test,getGrade)*.3 + d3.mean(penguin.homework,getGrade)* .15
    +d3.mean(penguin.quizes,getGrade)*.2
    +penguin.final[0].grade*.35, image: getPic(penguin)} 
    return report }
 classroom.map(gradeReport)</pre>
        <h2> C1 </h2>
        <p>We started by finding the first quiz score for a given penguin. We knew how to get the first quiz score because we noticed quizzes was an array and in order to get stuff from array we have to use index. Then we created an array of every penguin's first quiz score by using map.Then we the d3.mean to find the mean of the array we had just created with map. </p>
        <pre>  var getFirstQuiz= function(penguin){
        return penguin.quizes[0].grade;
        
        d3.mean(classroom.map(getFirstQuiz))
    } </pre>
